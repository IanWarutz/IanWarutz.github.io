   <p> Hello, world! My name is Ian, from Nairobi, Kenya. I am starting my journey on how to use html, CSS, Java Scrpit and python. It will be  a long journey, but I know that I will achieve my goals. Let's get coding.</p>

   <p> I had a bad notion concerning IT in general, which prevented me from learning new concepts. However, once I started coding with python,I got interested and wanted to learn more. One thing I noticed is that in development, your creativity is key. Thus, strive to get a solid foundation on the fundamentals of coding and create user-friendly programs.</p>
   <h2>Order of events</h2>
   <p class="paragraph1">I am going to learn coding in the following order:
   <ol>
        <li>Fundamentals of Python</li>
        <li>Basics of HTML</li>
        <li>Application of CSS</li>
        <li>Use of Java Script</li>
        <li>Building a simple website using the acquired knowledge</li>
        <li>Use of Django</li>
   </ol>
    </p>
<h2>How to become successful in coding</h2>
    <p class="paragraph2">Coding is <em>not easy</em>, and it requires <strong>a lot of hardwork and determination</strong>. The following are the ways in which you could use to be complete the journey:
    <ul>
        <li>Be committed</li>
        <li>Be willing to learn</li>
        <li>Find the right resources to guide you through coding</li>
        <li>Practice frequently</li>
        <li>Share your knowledge with others.</li>
    </ul>
With that, I believe that you will achieve what you are looking for.
    </p>
